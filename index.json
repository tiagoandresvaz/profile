Covid-19 Scenarios (by Neherlab) My contribution to the model, was to implement a new flux in the SIR model called “Palliative Flux”. The implementation was done using Typescript, Python and Node.js and involved many kinds of validations and complex epidemiology modelling. To accomplish this I had to set cloud enviroments (dev and production) with Continuous Integration and Delivery of software, so staticians could work on local models. Our enviroment was equiped with a data parser, to capture data from our local governament dashboards and after processing than, I have customized the calculator to build specific scenarios for 26 local regions. This was a work group with collaboration from statistics, medicine and computer science teachers from the federal university along with state authorities. We had supplied decisive information for beds and ICU planning during the pandemics in the State Of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. AGHUse (by Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre) AGHUse is a complete Hospital Information System (HIS) and Electronic Health Records (EHR) that I had the opportunity to co-found and stabilish as the most adopted university hospital software in Brasil. Now the project is mantained by the “Comunidade AGHUse: that includes partners like UNICAMP, Army, AirForce, states and other universities. Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (+900 beds) was appointed by the federal governament as a blueprint for a digital healthcare business model.
