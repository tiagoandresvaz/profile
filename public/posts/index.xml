    <description><![CDATA[During Covid-19 pandemics I had to compile my work as a Computer Scientist. To share it with other people around the world in projects that I am (or might be) involved.
I hope that my readers here, are also creating amazing software!
Special Motivation  I have built this website to learn Hugo (a very very nice static website creator coded using &ldquo;Go&rdquo;). This site is published at gihub.io, a free place to host web content like this!]]></description>
