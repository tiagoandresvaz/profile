#### Covid-19 Scenarios (by Neherlab)

My contribution to the model, was to implement a new flux in the SIR model called "Palliative Flux". Coding with Typescript, Python and Node.js and involving many kinds of data validations and complex epidemiology modelling. 

To accomplish this, I had to set cloud environments (dev and production) with Continuous Integration and Delivery of software, so statisticians could work on local models.

Our environment was equipped with a data parser, to capture data from our local government dashboards and after processing than, I have customized the calculator to build specific scenarios for 26 local regions.

This was a work group with collaboration from statistics, medicine and computer science teachers from the federal university along with state authorities.

#### AGHUse (by Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre)

AGHUse is a complete EHR (Electronic Health Record). 

I am the former Project Manager and Technical Leader, and latter the IT Executive in charge for rolling out it on the first 23 hospitals, including small, medium and large hospitals. 

Since the very first day I am an observer of the great progress that the project and his branches are delivering across the country. In 2016, we have put it as the most adopted university hospital software in Brasil. In 2017 the project received a Public Innovation Award from ENAP. 

Now the project is maintained by the "Comunidade AGHUse: that includes partners like UNICAMP, Army, AirForce, local governments and other universities.

Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (+900 beds) was appointed by the federal government in 2009 as a blueprint for a digital healthcare business model. Now its software is shared across the country.

#### Infection Surveillance Assistant (by Qualis Infectologia)

ISA is a robot. Made by automated artificial intelligence running at Amazon AWS. Provides solutions for hospitals to revamp infection control, help schools preventing outbreaks and hotels auditing protocols. In the future, we hope ISA will be an expert in infection related problems.
